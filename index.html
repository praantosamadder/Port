<!--
    This code is completely breakable because I took no steps no make sure not to. This was a fun project for a portfolio
    website, for which the design came straight from my mind. This is of course a fake command-line and hence doesn't do
    much. All the commands are fake and don't have any actual processing done behind the scenes. The network delays are
    simulated with JS.

    This code is probably quite easily breakable since no server-side code was designed to prevent it.

    This code isn't copyrighted. Not sure if I fully understand what that means though. Anyone can take the idea, although
    I'd really love it if someone gave some credit, I mean, who doesn't like that? ;)

    Even simply refreshing quick enough shows you some of the secrets I've put on this page.
